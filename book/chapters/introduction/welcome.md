## Welcome

I didn't start out knowing much about DNS. Sure, I knew there was something called an "A record" and a "CNAME." I knew it took "up to 48 hours for changes to propagate across the web." I knew that GoDaddy was "terrible." But when faced with a placeholder page that said "website coming soon," I felt like a donkey at a computer: not sure where to start.

I'm a web developer most days, so stepping through a problem methodically is my preferred way of working. In DNS, as in development, problems inevitably arise. Unlike development, however, DNS appears to defy a methodical approach to solving these problems. The tools and technologies are scattered and often don't resemble each other at first glance. We will walk through these tools together so that we can understand more or less how they work, and fix problems as they appear.

TLS has its own set of quirks, too. It is becoming more and more popular, and in some cases required, to have a secure website. This is easier said than done, however. The process involved in procuring and installing a certificate properly can be daunting to the uninitiated. Don't worry, though--we'll look at it in detail.

Finally, because I am a web developer, this book is very website-centric, but all techniques should work fine for a server with no outward-facing website, such as an API or an FTP server.

By the time we're done, you will be able to set up eight different kinds of records, use six command line tools, deal with a handful of common problems, and make a website secure.

Let's get started!
