## Software

You will need a few pieces of software to follow along with this book. The [appendix](#appendix) at the back of the book should be able to help you install anything missing. The software you will need is as follows:

* A web browser
* A command line (like the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Mac OS X)

On the command line, these pieces of software should be installed:

* dig
* openssl (or equivalent)
* whois

These are optional, but could prove useful anyway:

* host
* nslookup
* ping

If you're not sure if you have these pieces of software, the appendix contains instructions to check each one and install it if it is missing.
