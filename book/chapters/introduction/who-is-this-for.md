## Who is this book for?

As far as the subject matter for this book goes, I hope to make this whole process a bit more enjoyable than your average tech book by using lame jokes and silly examples. Frankly, writing in lame jokes is probably the only way I could ever finish writing this book.

Broadly, we are going to talk about DNS, how it works, and how to troubleshoot it. We are also going to look at TLS certificates and walk through not only how they work, but how to get and install one. If this sounds useful, then welcome.

As far as what you know coming into this book, I imagine you as a developer, or at a least technically minded individual, are probably a bit curious about how DNS works behind the scenes and have used a command line at least once in your life.

## Who is this book not for?

Have you _never_ touched the command line before and are totally scared of it? Do you have _no_ interest in having your own website? Then this book is probably not for you. No harm done, we'll give you a refund. I'd still urge you to give it a shot, though. Domains, DNS, and TLS can be very useful things to know about.
