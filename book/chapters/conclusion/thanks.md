## Thanks

First of all, thank _you_ dear reader. I wrote this book so you could absorb and enjoy it. If you've gotten this far, you probably don't hate it, which is a compromise I can settle for.

But also, I must thank a number of great people for helping me with this book:

* Caleb Thompson and thoughtbot, for thinking, "Yeah, you're probably qualified to write a book." Caleb especially, for answering all my inane questions and encouraging me to write.
* Mike Burns, for tearing apart my god-awful first draft of the "Securing Your Website" chapter.
* Frank Wang, for patiently explaining how public-key infrastructure works and reading through the "Securing Your Website" chapter.
* My wife, Elizabeth, for reading a chapter once and hating it, but loving me despite that.
* My mother, Kathie, who read early drafts and even opened the command line a few times to test things.
* Gabe Berke-Williams, for laughing at my incredibly dumb jokes and testing absurd scenarios with me.
* Josh, Diana, and Tute, for taking time to read through chapters and fixing my grammar and spelling mistakes.
