## WHOIS

Let's clear up one thing real fast: WHOIS in all caps is a protocol. `whois` all lowercase is a command line tool. They are related, but not the same thing. The `whois` tool uses the WHOIS protocol to retrieve information about a domain. We'll be interacting with `whois` directly, and WHOIS indirectly.

The information we get using `whois` is different for every domain. The most common and useful pieces include contact information for the person or company that registered the domain, and/or the expiration date of that domain. The catch is that this information has no standard to it. I can be any information, in any format.

Let's take a look at a response. It's a long one:

Hello. Welcome to like, three pages later.

There's a lot here as we can see. Most of it is legal disclaimer. This is because WHOIS information has been the source of a lot of legal trouble over the years. The act of publicly displaying a customers personal information has caused a lot of problems as one might imagine.

There's also some meta information about the servers that were contacted to get this information and also some pseudo-advertisements. For the most part you can ignore these.

Towards the middle is the information we're probably looking for: who the domain is registered to and who when it expires. This can give us leads for who to contact if there's a problem or when the domain might go up for sale.

This is just one example of what a `com` domain will return but as I said, each TLD is different. Here's another response from a `gov` domain:

```shell
$ whois nasa.gov

% DOTGOV WHOIS Server ready
   Domain Name: NASA.GOV
   Status: ACTIVE

>>> Last update of whois database: 2016-01-20T19:12:13Z <<<
Please be advised that this whois server only contains information pertaining
to the .GOV domain. For information for other domains please use the whois
server at RS.INTERNIC.NET.
```

Much shorter! This is because there's no guide or specification that dictates what WHOIS information needs to include or how it should be formatted. What a great "standard" this is!

Another aspect to consider: since all this information is stored on different servers, occasionally we'll need to specify which server to use. For example, if we try to look up a `dentist` domain we get:

```shell
$ whois donkey.dentist

whois: dentist.whois-servers.net: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

It can't find the right server! Luckily the [root zone database](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db) list all TLDs and their WHOIS server info. Clicking on the dentist domain gives up a bunch of information about the TLD and at the bottom, a WHOIS server: `whois.rightside.co`. Now we can make our WHOIS query using the `-h` option:

```
$ whois -h whois.rightside.co donkey.dentist

Domain not found.

...
```

Be right back, I need to go register a domain real quick.

---

Honestly, the more I look into WHOIS the less I am a fan of it. I has it uses such as a quick check to see if a domain is registered, but overall, it's a mess. The Internet Engineering Task Force (which wins for best company name in this whole book) and ICANN both [recognize](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3912#section-5) that WHOIS is flawed and are [trying to replace it](https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf).

Hopefully we'll see this happen, but it's what we have for now.
