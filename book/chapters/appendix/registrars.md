## Recommended Registrars

Feeling overwhelmed by the number of registrars out there? Here are three that I recommend:

* [Hover](https://www.hover.com)
* [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com)
* [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net)

Hover has a great control panel and awesome customer support if you need it. The only thing they lack is ALIAS/ANAME record support. DNSimple lives up to its name and supports many features, including ALIAS/ANAME. They cost slightly more than other registrars, but it's worth it if you're a bit intimidated by managing a domain name. Gandi comes very highly recommended from colleagues.
